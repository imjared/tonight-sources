				<p class="show-text" id="bio">Born and raised in Compton, California, Travon Free is a stand-up comedian, actor and writer who towers over most at 6'7". The 25 year old former Cal State Long Beach basketball center has already accomplished a lot in his career appearing on such shows as <em>Chelsea Lately</em>, <em>Tosh.0</em>, <em>House</em>, <em>Party Down</em>, and <em>Southland</em> and is currently an Emmy nominated writer on <em>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</em>. In his off-time from the show, Travon tours the country doing stand-up and regularly opens for his comedy mentor, Russell Peters. With his keen and sometimes odd observations, he is willing to not only step up to the line, but is also very willing to cross it to make his point. Not only will you find yourself laughing from his silliness and unapologetic, brutal honesty, he will also leave you thinking and questioning your own place in this mad world. With Razor sharp wit and a dazzling smile, it's almost impossible to feel offended or threatened by his larger than life presence. Boasting a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and always a top of the class graduate, his undeniable intelligence takes his comedy to a new thought provoking level. </p>
